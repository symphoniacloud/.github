![Hello from Symphonia!](https://blog.symphonia.io/images/logo-text-horizontal-white-on-blue-500.png)

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to [Symphonia](https://symphonia.io/)'s home on Github. Symphonia is [John Chapin](https://github.com/johnchapin) 
and [Mike Roberts](https://github.com/mikebroberts) - we've been helping companies use AWS and Serverless since 2017.

We have a number of public repositories, some of which are mentioned below, but please explore! You may also be interested in our
blog at https://blog.symphonia.io/ , and you can also email us at [johnandmike@symphonia.io](mailto:johnandmike@symphonia.io) .

### Our book

We wrote a book with O'Reilly on Lambda - you can buy it [here](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-aws-lambda/9781492041047/)!

You don't need to buy the book to see the example source code though - you can find that in [`programming-aws-lambda-book`](https://github.com/symphoniacloud/programming-aws-lambda-book)
